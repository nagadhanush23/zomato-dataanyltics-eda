## 📊🍽️ **Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis — EDA & Insights**

---

### 📑 **About the Project**

Zomato has an average of **17.5 million monthly transacting customers** for its food delivery business. Additionally, the **average monthly active restaurant partners** on Zomato's platform have increased by **8.7% year-on-year**, growing from **208,000 to 226,000**.

As a data professional at Zomato, my role involves analyzing customer and restaurant data to derive insights that help in improving business decisions and enhancing customer experiences.

In this project, I have performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and data visualizations on a dataset containing restaurant details like name, ratings, votes, cost, order type preferences, and restaurant type.
